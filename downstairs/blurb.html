Sometimes a piece gets a special place to hang :)

“People rely on intelligence to solve problems, and they are naturally baffled when comprehension proves 
impotent to effect emotional change. To the neocortical brain, rich in the power of abstractions, 
understanding makes all the difference, but it doesn’t count for much in the neural systems that evolved 
before understanding existed. Ideas bounce like so many peas off the sturdy incomprehension of the limbic 
and reptilian brains. The dogged implicitness of emotional knowledge, its relentless unreasoning force, 
prevents logic from granting salvation just as it precludes self-help books from helping. The sheer volume 
and variety of self-help paraphernalia testify at once to the vastness of the appetite they address and 
their inability to satisfy it.” <br/><br/>

from A General Theory of Love (Lewis, Amini, and Lannon 2000) <br/><br/>
