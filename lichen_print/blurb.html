Inverted Lobaria Pulmonaria
Lichen Ink Print and Pen on Paper
2025-03-20
I collaborated with a local xylophile to create this ink print of a <i>Lobaria Pulmonaria</i> 
lichen we collected on the Oregon coast. We used a pen to fill in light spots and imagine some additional tendrils, 
and the colors are inverted. Source lichen pictured below!
